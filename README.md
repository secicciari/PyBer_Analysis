# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
I've been asked to analyze PyBer's ride-sharing data to identify how the data differs by city type (urban, suburban, rural) and to make recommendations to PyBer's CEO based on my findings.
To do this analysis I will first create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride-sharing data by city type and then I will create a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. This analysis will give me a clear picture of the differences across city types.

## Results
Desribe the differences in ride sharing data among different city types (total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, total fare by city type)
On average, rides in rural cities cost about 12% and 41% more than suburban and urban cities, respectively. There are fewer drivers in rural cities (78, compared to 490 in suburban cities and 2,405 in urban cities), which results in an average fare per driver that is higher than both surburban and urban cities. 
According to the data I analyzed, rural cities account for the fewest rides, while urban cities account for the most. In terms of total fare revenue, rural cities are responsible for about 7% of PyBer's total fare revenue, suburban cities are responsible for about 30%, and urban cities make up the remaining 63%.

The fare summary pictured below captures weekly fare revenue in each city type between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. The graph clearly shows that rural cities consistently make up the lowest total fare per week. 
It's also worth noting the each city type hits its peak at a different time within this period - urban cities are highest at the end of February and in early March, suburban cities are highest at the end of February and the end of April, and rural cities are highest at the beginning of April.

## Summary
Based on these I results, I make the following recommendations:
1. Because of the differences in peak weekly fares across the city types, I believe it would be worthwhile to dig further into data around usage in each of those city types to identify new opportunities for marketing. For example, urban cities might see an uptick in rides (and therefore fares) in early spring because that corresponds to school spring break and brings tourists into more urban areas.
2. Based on the low average fare per driver in urban cities, PyBer should explore avenues to limit the total number of drivers that are active on the platform, or increase marketing in these areas to attract more riders. Currently, there are more drivers in the system than rides being taken. 
3. The data shows that riders in rural cities spend more per ride, on average, than in suburban and urban cities. However, they take significantly fewer rides. PyBer should make rural customers more aware of their offerings and suggest examples for how PyBer can be useful, even when you are located far from a city center.
